    git의 기초를 탄탄하게 하기 위한 기본 흐름과 명령어들을 번역하여 정리한다.

~~~
매일(?) 사용하는 GIT 을 더 잘 사용하기 위해 많이 기초부터 정리하도록 한다.
잘 정리되어있는 외국 블로그를 발견하게 되어 이를 참고하여 번역해서 정리하도록 한다.

## 1. Git 흐름

일단, git과 github가 무엇인지 아는 상태에서 큰 흐름은 다음과 같다.

각 명령어는 아래 'Git 명령어 모음'의 '2.1 git workflow'에서 사용법 및 간단한 설명이 나와있다.

## 2. Git 기본 명령어 모음 - git workflow을 중심으로

### 2.1 initialize and clone
```bash
# initialize a git repository in the current working directory
git init

# clone a remote repository over https
git clone https://remote.com/repo.git

# clone a remote repository over ssh
git clone ssh://git@remote.com:/repo.git

# recursively clone a repository over https
git clone --recursive https://remote.com/repo.git

# recursively clone a repository over ssh
git clone --recursive ssh://git@remote.com:/repo.git
```

### 2.2 track, add and commit
```bash
# start tracking a file or add its current state to the index
git add file

# add everything which is tracked and has been changed to the index
git add -u

# add everything which is untracked or has been changed to the index
git add .

# commit to local history with a given message
git commit -m "message"

# add all changes to already tracked files and commit with a given 
# message, non-tracked files are excluded
git commit -am "message"

# modify the last commit including both new modifications and given message
git commit --amend -m "message"

# perform a commit with an empty message
git commit --allow-empty-message -m
```

### 2.3 status and diagnostics
```bash
git status			# show status of the working directory 
git status -s			# show short version status

git show HEAD			# show commit at the head of current branch 
git show mycommit		# show commit with object ID mycommit 
git show HEAD:folder/file	# show version of folder/file at HEAD
```

### 2.4 checking out
```bash
# replace file-name with the latest version from the current branch
git checkout -- filename

# in case fileorbranch is a file, replace fileorbranch with the latest version
# of the file on the current branch. In case fileorbranch is a branch, replace
# the working tree with the head of said branch.
git checkout fileorbranch

# replace the current working tree with commit 05c5fa
git checkout 05c5fa

# replace the current working tree with the head of the main branch
git checkout main
```

### 2.5 remotes
```bash
# show the remote branches and their associated urls
git remote -v 

# adds an https url as remote branch under the name origin
git remote add -f origin https://remote.com/repo.git

# adds an ssh url as remote branch under the name origin
git remote add -f origin ssh://git@remote.com:/repo.git

# remove the remote with ID origin
git remote remove -f origin

# set an https url for the remote with ID origin
git remote set-url origin https://remote.com/repo.git

# set an ssh url for the remote with ID origin
git remote set-url origin ssh://git@remote.com:/repo.git

# clean up remote non-existent branches
git remote prune origin 

# set the upstream branch, to which changes will be pushed, to origin/main
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main

# set foo as the tracking branch for origin/bar
git branch –track foo origin/bar

# update local tracking branches with changes from their respective remote ones
git fetch

# update local tracking branches and remove local references to
# non-existent remote branches
git fetch -p

# delete remote tracking branch origin/branch
git branch -r -d origin/branch

# update local tracking branches and merge changes with local working directory
git pull

# given one or more existing commits, apply the change each one introduces,
# recording a new commit for each. This requires your working tree to be clean 
git cherry-pick commitid

# push HEAD to the upstream url
git push

# push HEAD to the remote named origin
git push origin 

# push HEAD to the branch main on the remote origin 
git push origin main

# push and set origin main as upstream
git push -u origin main

# delete previous commits and push your current one
# WARNING: never use force in repositories from which other have pulled [1]
# https://stackoverflow.com/a/16702355
git push --force all origin/main

# a safer option to force-push that will not overwrite work on the remote
# branch if more commits were added ensuring someone else's work is not overwritten
git push --force-with-lease

# turn the head of a branch into a commit in the currently checked out branch and merge it
git merge --squash mybranch
```

### 2.6 revert and reset
```bash 
# figures out the changes introduced by commitid and introduces a new commit undoing them. 
git revert commitid

# does the same but doesn't automatically commit
git revert -n commitid

# updates the index and the HEAD to match the state of commit id. 
# changes made after this commit are moved to “not yet staged for commit” 
git reset commitid

# sets only the HEAD to commitid
git reset --soft commitid

# sets the HEAD, index and working directory to commitid
git reset --hard commitid

# sets the HEAD, index and working directory to origin/main 
git reset --hard origin/main
```

### 2.7 the stash
```bash
# take all changes made to working tree and stash them in a new dangling commit, putting 
# the working tree in a clean state
# DISCLAIMER: this does not include untracked files
git stash

# stash everything into a dangling commit, including untracked files
stash save --include-untracked

git stash push file # push individual or multiple files to the stash 

# apply the changes which were last stashed to the current working tree
git pop

# show the stash of commits
git stash list

# apply a particular commit in the stash
git stash apply

# apply the second-to-last commit in the stash
git stash apply stash@{2}

# drop the second-to-last commit in the stash
git stash drop stash@{2}

# stash only the changes made to the working directory but keep the index unmodified
git stash --keep-index

# clear the stash
git stash clear
```
